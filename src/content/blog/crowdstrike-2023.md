# The Webinar
The webinar was hosted by Crowdstrike. It featured 2 speakers: Adam Meyers, Senior Vice President at Crowdstrike Intelligence; Kurt Baker, Senior Product Director at Crowdstrike.

## Summary
The webinar covered cybersecurity threat trends, including identifying countries associated with high levels of malicious activity, discussing tactics employed by threat actors, and providing guidance on protecting your business.

# My Experience
The webinar was around 1 hour long and didn't contain that much interaction so it got a bit monotonous in my experience. They also publish these threat reports so I personally find reading them more preferable than watching the webinar. 

# Conclusion
The threat reports are interesting so I would recommend reading or watching the webinar depending on your preference.
