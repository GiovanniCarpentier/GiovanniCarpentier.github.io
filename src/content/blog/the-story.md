As an assignment for school, we had to create a personal website to showcase ourselves. We got a free hosting plan from school on Combell with a domain name. This is where the story starts!

## The Start
The hosting we got was WordPress hosting. I've worked with WordPress before so my first thought was to just use a WordPress theme and create my website. 

The theme I chose was alright when I first looked at it but I quickly ran into problems. The website felt cluttered there was a lot of stuff that I didn't need but I couldn't remove it because I didn't have access to these elements. 

Overall the website felt way too not personal and not like me. 

## The Fix
I decided to ditch the whole WordPress thing and just make my own site from scratch. This would fix all the issues I had with WordPress before.

To create the site I decided to use the Astro framework. It was my first time using this framework and I do really enjoy it. Astro has a lot of features that came in handy to create my website and I was able to set it up quite quickly. 

I started with the basic Astro blog template project and customized it to my liking. I really like the functionality of Astro that which integrates with other frameworks like React. 

Astro can act as the CMS to index your blog posts on a page. This made it really easy to get the whole site together. 

Another feature that I enjoy with Astro is the ability to use Markdown to create a page. All the blog posts are written in Notion and then exported as a Markdown file in my Astro project. This way I don't have to write the articles in HTML. 

The only issue I had then was that the hosting came with WordPress CMS and I couldn't change that so I bought my own hosting on Hostinger and migrated the site.

## The Design
I kept the design pretty minimal. I like to keep all my tech minimal and don't bloat it with stuff I don't need. This is why I kept the site minimalto reflect my minimal approach to technology.

The website has 3 pages.
1. **Homepage** with a quick intro about me and the things I am currently working on.
2. **About me** page with a more in depth look at the skills I have.
3. The **blog** page that brought you to this article.

I added a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn in the menu. 

## Conclusion
I really like the way my site turned out. It was a bit of a rough start but everything fell into place in time.
