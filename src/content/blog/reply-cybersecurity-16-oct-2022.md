# The challenge
The Reply Cybersecurity challenge is a 24-hour Capture The Flag competition held from October 14 to 15, 2022, where teams of up to 4 members participate. The competition includes challenges from 5 different categories: Coding, Web, Binary, Crypto, and Miscellaneous, which combines different categories into one.  

# Experience
I joined forces with two friends to participate in the challenge, and despite our lack of experience in CTFs, we had a great time. While we didn't manage to solve many challenges, we did learn some new techniques and strategies. The challenges were thought-provoking and required us to think creatively to solve them.

# Conclusion
I highly recommend taking part in the challenge if it comes around again, as well as other challenges hosted by Reply, such as their coding and investing challenges. It's a great opportunity to learn new skills, challenge yourself, and have fun with a team.
