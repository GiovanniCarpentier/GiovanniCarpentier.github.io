# The Conference
GitHub Galaxy was a four-day conference hosted by GitHub from March 28 to March 31. The conference featured sessions on a wide range of topics, including software development cycles, AI, security, and productivity. The event boasted a large number of speakers from various industries, including GitHub employees and senior developers in the tech industry.

# My Experience
Attending GitHub Galaxy was an enlightening experience that gave me valuable insights into the workings of tech companies, but I would say that the conference is primarily geared towards enterprise managers. That being said, it can still be interesting to watch if one works in a company that uses GitHub, as the conference showcases the latest developments in GitHub tools. Many of the sessions focused on how GitHub's enterprise tools can optimize team productivity and offered advice on how to manage teams effectively.

## Small summary of the sessions
The four-day GitHub Galaxy conference was packed with informative sessions. On the first day, the kickoff presentation focused on GitHub Co-Pilot and enterprise features. The second day featured two sessions on software development, covering topics such as writing high-quality code more efficiently. The third day's session focused on security practices in the development experience. Finally, on the fourth day, there were two sessions on collaboration, with a focus on using enterprise tools to improve developer productivity and the onboarding experience.

# Conclusion
Overall, I found the GitHub Galaxy conference to be an interesting and informative experience. While I wouldn't say it's a must-attend event, I would definitely consider watching it again next year if I have the time. It's a valuable opportunity to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in GitHub tools and how they can benefit enterprise teams.
