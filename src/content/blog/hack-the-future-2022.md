# The Hackathon
Hack The Future is a hackathon organized by The Cronos Group, a consortium of technology companies in Belgium. The event was well-organized and had a professional atmosphere, with many companies from within the Cronos Group in attendance. Participants could choose to attend the event either online or in-person in Antwerp. 

# Experience
Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the event in person, so I and a friend participated online. We took on the Laravel challenge organized by Codana, which involved building a potion mixing website using Laravel and presenting our project at the end to demonstrate our skills. Following the challenge, we had the opportunity to speak with representatives from Codana about potential future work opportunities.

# Conclusion
If you work in the tech industry, Hack The Future is definitely an event to consider attending to build your professional network. The event is well-organized and professional, making for a fun and informative experience. I would recommend participating in this event every year to stay connected with others in the industry and to continue learning.
