			<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hello, My name is Giovanni <br>Welcome to my corner on the web!</h1>
			<p>
				Ever since I was a child, I have been deeply fascinated by the field of IT and cybersecurity. I have always known that I wanted to pursue a career in informatics, which is why I decided to follow my passion and enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program in Applied Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity.
				<br><br>
				I am deeply committed to this field and believe that my combination of technical skills and knowledge of cybersecurity will enable me to contribute to the industry in a meaningful way. I am eager to learn and grow in my field, and I believe that my degree program will provide me with the knowledge and practical experience necessary to achieve my career goals.
